    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We met in the most unexpected way — at a mutual friend's party, both thinking we’d never meet someone like each other. It was love at first laugh, and since then, we’ve been building a life full of adventure, laughter, and love. From spontaneous road trips to cozy nights in, we’ve found that the best moments are those shared together.</p>

    <h3>How We Met</h3>
    <p>It was a rainy Saturday evening, and we both showed up at a mutual friend's dinner party. Neither of us were expecting much... but then came the karaoke challenge, and we knew that night was going to be unforgettable!</p>

    <h3>The Proposal</h3>
    <p>After years of traveling the world together, we decided that our next adventure should be the biggest one of all — a life spent together. So, on a beautiful beach in Bali, surrounded by close friends and family, Jamie asked Alex to marry them... and the answer was, of course, YES!</p>

    <h3>What We Love</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Exploring new places and foods</li>
      <li>Having long, deep conversations</li>
      <li>Spending Sundays in comfy sweatpants</li>
      <li>Laughing until our cheeks hurt</li>
    </ul>
